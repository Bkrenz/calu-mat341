\section*{Section 1.3: Vector Equations}

\begin{itemize}

  \item A matrix with only one column is called a \definition{column vector}, or simply a \definition{vector}.
  
  \item An example of a vector with two entries, where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are any real numbers, is:
  \begin{equation*}
      w = \begin{bmatrix}
        w_1 \\ w_2
      \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation*}

  \item The set of all vectors with 2 entries is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  
  \item The $\mathbb{R}$ stands for the real numbers that appear as entries in the vector, and the exponent 2 indicates that each vector contains 2 entries.
  
  \item Two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are \textbf{equal} if and only if their corresponding entries are equal.
  
  \item Given two vectors \textbf{u} and \textbf{v} in $\mathbb{R}^2$, their \textbf{sum} is the vector $\textbf{u} + \textbf{v}$ obtained by adding the corresponding entries of \textbf{u} and \textbf{v}.
  
  \item Given a vector \textbf{u} and a real number \textbf{c}, the \definition{scalar multiplication} of \textbf{u} by \textbf{c} is the vector \textbf{cu} obtained by multiplying each entry in \textbf{u} by \textbf{c}.
  
  \item Consider a rectangular coordinate system in the plane. Because each point in the plane is determined by an ordered pair of numbers, we can identify a geometric point $(a,b)$ with the column vector 
  $\begin{bmatrix}
    a \\ b
  \end{bmatrix}$.

  \item We may regard $\mathbb{R}^2$ as the set of all points in the plane
  
  \item The vector whose entries are all zero is called the \definition{zero vector} and is denoted by \textbf{0}.
  
  \item For all \textbf{u}, \textbf{v}, \textbf{w}, in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and scalars \textit{c} and \textit{d}:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $u + v = v + u$
      \item $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$
      \item $u + 0 = 0 + u = u$
      \item $u + (-u) = 0$
      \item $c(u + v) = cu + cv$
      \item $(c+d)u = cu + du$
      \item $c(du) = (cd)u$
      \item $1u = u$
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The vector $y = c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_pv_p$ is called a \definition{linear combination}.
  
  \item A vector Equation
  \begin{equation*}
      x_1a_1 + \cdots + x_na_n = b
  \end{equation*}
  has the same solution set as the linear system whose augmented matrix is
  \begin{equation*}
      \begin{bmatrix}
          a_1 & a_2 & \cdots & a_n & b
      \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation*}

  \item If $v_1, \ldots, v_p$ are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then the set of all linear combinations of $v_1, \ldots, v_p$ is denoted by
  $Span\{v_1, \ldots, v_p\}$ and is called the \definition{subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ spanned by $v_1, \ldots, v_p$}.

\end{itemize}
